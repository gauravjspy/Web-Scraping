Learn how to leverage amazing Python to srcap data from websites.

The end goal of this project is to srcap and analyze the data for Machine learning model.

I'll be using python 3.9, requests, bs4, urllib.request, datetime and sqlite3(for database)

If you have already install python in your system then no worry, if not then install it from https://www.python.org/

After successfully install python we need to install some modules for web scraping which is mention above. for installing modules we need to used 'pip' command.
i.e  open your CMD/Powershell and type pip install requests
"pip install is the command"
"requests is the module name"
